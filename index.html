        Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that focuses
        on artificial intelligence,[10] search engine, online advertising, cloud
        computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, and
        consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the "most powerful
        company in the world" and one of the world's most valuable brands due to
        its market dominance,<br /><br />
        data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial
        intelligence.[11][12][13][14] It is considered one of the Big Five
        American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple,
        Meta, and Microsoft. Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry
        Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University
        in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares
        and control 56% of the stockholder voting power through super-voting
        stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in
        2004.<br />
        In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet
        Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company
        for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was
        appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who
        became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the
        CEO of Alphabet.[15] The company has since rapidly grown to offer a
        multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which
        hold dominant market positions.

        These products address a wide range of use cases, including email
        (Gmail), navigation (Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing
        (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating
        systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation
        (Translate), photo storage (Photo), video calling (Meet), smart home
        (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Fitbit), gaming
        (Stadia), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (TV),
        artificial intelligence (Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow),
        AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include Glass,
        Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by
        Gmail.[16][17] Other areas of interest to Google include quantum
        computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google
        self-driving project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer
        models (Google Brain). Google and YouTube are the two most visited
        websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Google is also the
        largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email
        provider, office suite, video sharing platform,<br />

        photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser,
        ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured
        by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked
        second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received
        significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax
        avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its
        monopoly position. Google began in January 1996 as a research project by
        Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford
        University in California.[20][21][22] The project initially involved an
        unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer
        who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he
        left before Google was officially founded as a company;[23][24] Hassan
        went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow
        Garage in 2006.[25][26] While conventional search engines ranked results
        by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they
        theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among
        websites.[27] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a
        website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those
        pages that linked back to the original site.[28][29] Page told his ideas
        to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas.[23]
        Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub",

        Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub",
        because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a
        site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[20][30][31] Hassan as well as
        Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the
        development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later
        co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project,
        describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search
        engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were
        also cited as contributors to the project.[32] PageRank was influenced
        by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for
        RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank
        patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later
        went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[33][34]because the
